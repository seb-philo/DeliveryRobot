## Summary
This projected involved the physical design - CAD and standard component selection, the circuit design and microcontroller C++ software development, and the adaption into Webots robotic simulation software, to demonstrate functionality with real world modelling and physics.

## Hospital environment modelling
The simulation required a hospital room to be modelled, with objects, packages and humans modelled to interact with. A set of tasks were to be completed, including following carefully planned routes, as well as free roaming. Additionally, to search out both humans to recieve and transport packages.

## Electronics and Software.
This robot used a range of sensors, including: a force sensor, GPS, IMU, a camera, ultrasonic distance senors and impact sensors; these were paired with electronics such as actuators and microcontrollers, and a state based control system to complete the required tasks.<img width="600" height="545" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-02 150118" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac31ee86-6496-428f-be31-ed8de17f833c" />
